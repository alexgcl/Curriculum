Information architecture : 
To begin with, I placed my name as a title in the center of my CV website. Just below it, within the header, I included a navigation bar for easy access to each section. At the same level as my name, on the left side of the page, I positioned my profile photo.

Continuing down the left sidebar, after my image, I organized basic information about myself. This section includes my contact details, a brief personal description under "About Me," and a summary of my key skills.

For the main content area in the center, I divided it into two columns. In the left column, I decided to put three sections. Firstly, I provide a detailed overview of my work experience. Following this, I included some of my interests, which highlight areas Iâ€™d like to work in, and all my certifications up to the present date and where I studied. In the right column, I placed the remaining two sections. I listed the fields in which I have knowledge and can work. Below this, I included a section that shows the languages I speak and my proficiency level in each.

Finally, at the bottom of my CV website, we can find the footer.
